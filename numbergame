***************NUMBER GAME*****************
step 1==> here first we have to create randomnumber by import random library
step 2==> take the input from the user 
step 3==> take onr number for exiting the loop (ex:10)
step 4==> create two variables and stroe randomnumber and input to them 
step 5==> create correct variable and assiagn to "0"
step 6==>check each digit in number by using the loop for both random number and input
step 7==>if both of the numbers equal then increment the correct variable to +1
step 8==>if the number is equals to the random return true else repear step 6 and return corect positions of the variable
